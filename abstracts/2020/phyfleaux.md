# JIT Code Generation for PhySL Expression Trees.
to our knowledge no framework tries to jointly optimize the choice of which fragments of a computation should run on which device with the choice of how to structure the sub-computations within a device.


## Data

Extend :class: `numpy.nd` to support distributed and GPU arrays.

## Computation
- user-defined tasks
- task order / dependency 
- representations

## Code generation
- PhySL
- ISL

## Optimization
- Polyhedral
