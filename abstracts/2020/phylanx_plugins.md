# Phylanx Specializations, a.k.a, Plug-ins

## Problem
Phylanx provide a core set of primitives that are used in almost all kinds of applications. It is also possible to extend Phylanx primitives for different class of applications. This is possible by creating new primitives by combining other primitives, or implement one and plug-in as shared library- this approach may selected based on necessity or performance considerations

## Contribution
example plugins:
- NumPy
- Keras
